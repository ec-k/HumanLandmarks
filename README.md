# Human Landmarks

[日本語版はこちら](README_jp.md)

This repository defines the estimation results for tracking applications that operate avatars through pose estimation.

It was created for integration with the following applications:

- [VioletSolver](https://github.com/ec-k/VioletSolver)
- [MediapipeAndKinectInferencer](https://github.com/ec-k/MediapipeAndKinectInferencer)

Normally, it's conceivable to use only the Proto files in each application and generate them individually. However, to save that effort, the `Runtime/` directory already contains files generated by `protoc`, making them immediately usable.

Additionally, `.meta` files are included so that it can be used as a Unity Package Manager (UPM) package. If you intend to use this package in your own application, we recommend using [GitDependencyResolverForUnity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity).

## How to Build

Execute `build_proto.ps1` from PowerShell. This will generate and place built files for C# and Python in the `Runtime` directory.

## Operating Environment

- Windows 11: Confirmed to work
- Other OS: Unconfirmed
